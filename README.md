# Superstore-Sales-Analysis

The primary goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of sales data to extract meaningful insights into sales performance, pinpoint emerging trends, and formulate data-driven business strategies. The aim is to enhance decision-making processes by leveraging valuable information derived from the analysis.

The following steps have been taken for the analysis:
1. The original dataset has been pre-processed using Python to standardize the date columns, check for any missing values etc.
2. The processed dataset was then imported into a new .csv file for analysis
3. In-depth analysis is carried out using PostgreSQL.
4. Visualization of the data is done using PowerBI.
