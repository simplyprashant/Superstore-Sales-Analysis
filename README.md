# Superstore-Sales-Analysis

The primary goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of sales data to extract meaningful insights into sales performance, pinpoint emerging trends, and formulate data-driven business strategies. The aim is to enhance decision-making processes by leveraging valuable information derived from the analysis.

Business problem:
How can the business optimize profits by identifying best performing products, categories, sub-categories, or regions? What are the top performing products and which ones need improvement?

The following steps have been taken for the analysis:
1. The original dataset has been pre-processed using Python to standardize the date columns, check for any missing values etc.
2. The processed dataset was then imported into a new .csv file for analysis
3. In-depth analysis is carried out using PostgreSQL.
4. Visualization of the data is done using PowerBI.


### Query 1: Calculating total sales and profit by year

Net sales and profit is calculated for each year using the below query

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "Order Date") AS order_year,
    SUM("Sales") AS total_sales,
    SUM("Profit") AS total_profit
FROM store
GROUP BY order_year
ORDER BY order_year;
```
This is result achieved. It is clear that the net sales and profit have generally increased throughout the years (2014-2017) except in 2015 where there was a small dip in sales as compared to the previous year.
